In 3Fe(s) + 4H\u2082O(g) \u2192 Fe\u2083O\u2084(s) + 4H\u2082(g), the (g) means water is in gaseous form (steam) at the reaction temperature, not necessarily at room temperature.",

        "correct": "All three reasons are correct. Changing subscripts (e.g., H\u2082O to H\u2082O\u2082) creates a completely different substance with different properties and composition. This violates the law of conservation of mass and changes what we're actually balancing.",

Hmm, this doesn't match. Let me recalculate: 5.4/27 = 0.2. 0.2 \u00d7 133.5 = 26.7. But option A is 20.25. Let me check: 20.25/133.5 = 0.1515... Hmm. Actually, let me verify the molar mass: Al = 27, Cl = 35.5, so AlCl\u2083 = 27 + 106.5 = 133.5. And 5.4/27 = 0.2 moles. So mass should be 0.2 \u00d7 133.5 = 26.7 g. But this isn't an option. Let me reconsider if the question is different. If 5.4 g Al: 5.4/27 = 0.2 mol. If ratio is 2:2, then 0.2 mol AlCl\u2083 \u00d7 133.5 = 26.7. But if we check option A: 20.25 g. 20.25/0.2 = 101.25, which isn't the molar mass. Let me try: 20.25/133.5 = 0.1515 mol. This would require 0.1515 \u00d7 27 = 4.09 g Al, not 5.4 g. I think there might be an error in the question setup. However, if we work backwards: if answer is 20.25 and molar mass is 133.5, then moles = 20.25/133.5 \u2248 0.1515.
